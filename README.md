# NFACT

*This is a repo merging NFacT (Shaun Warrington, Ellie Thompson, and Stamatios Sotiropoulos) and ptx_decomp (Saad Jbabdi and Rogier Mars).*

## What is NFACT

NFACT (Non-negative matrix Factorisation of Tractography data) is a set of modules (as well as an end to end pipeline) that decomposes 
tractography data using NMF/ICA.

It consists of three "main" decomposition modules:
    
    - nfact_pp (Pre-process data for decomposition)
    
    - nfact_decomp (Decomposes a single or average group matrix using NMF or ICA)
    
    - nfact_dr (Dual regression on group matrix)

as well as two axillary "modules":
    
    - nfact_config (creates config files for the pipeline and changing any hyperparameters)
    
    - nfact_glm (To run hypothesis testing)
and a pipeline wrapper
    
    - nfact (runs either all three pre-processing modules or just nfact_decomp and nfact_dr)

## NFACT pipeline

This pipeline runs nfact_pp, nfact_decomp and nfact_dr on tractography data that has been processed by bedpostx. 


The pipeline first creates the omatrix2 


### Usage:

```
usage: nfact [-h] [-l LIST_OF_SUBJECTS] [-s SEED [SEED ...]] [-c CONFIG] [-S] [-i REF] [-b BPX_PATH] [-w WARPS [WARPS ...]] [-r ROIS [ROIS ...]] [-t TARGET2] [-d DIM] [-o OUTDIR] [-a ALGO]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

Inputs:
  -l LIST_OF_SUBJECTS, --list_of_subjects LIST_OF_SUBJECTS

## NFACT PP
Pre-processing of tractgraphy data for decomposition with NFacT (Non-negative matrix Factorisation of Tractography data)

Under the hood NFACT PP is probtrackx2 omatrix2 option to get a seed by target connectivity matrix 

### Input for nfact_preproc

Required before runing NFACT PP:
    - crossing-fibre diffusion modelled data (bedpostX)
    - Seeds (either surfaces or volumes)

NFACT PP has three streams, surface seed, volume, mode and filestree.

Required input:
    - List of subjects
    - Output directory

Input needed for filestree mode:
    - .tree file (NFACT_PP comes with some defaults such as hcp)

Input needed for both surface and volume mode:
    - Seeds path inside folder
    - Warps path inside a subjects folder
    - bedpostx folder path inside a subjects folder
   
Input for surface seed mode:
    - Seeds as surfaces
    - ROIs as surfaces (medial wall)
    
Input needed for volume mode:
    - Seeds as volumes 

 ### NFACT PP input folder 

NFACT pp can be used in a folder agnostic way by providing the paths to seeds/bedpostX/target inside a subject folder (i.e --seeds seeds/amygdala.nii.gz).

The other way is to use the --file_tree command with the name of a file tree (see https://open.win.ox.ac.uk/pages/fsl/file-tree/index.html for further details on filetree).
In this case seeds/rois/bedpostx do not need to be specified as nfact_pp will try and find the appriopriate files.

```
nfact_pp --file_tree hcp --list_of_subjects /home/study/list_of_subjects
```

Filetrees are saved in filetrees folder in nfact, so custom filetrees can be put there and called similar to the command above. NFACT_PP currently has a built in a filetree for HCP (from qunex output) to perform full brain tractography. 

Use of custom filetree
-----------------------
seed files are aliased as (seed), medial wall as (medial_wall), warps as (diff2std, std2diff) and bedpostX as (bedpostX). Two seeds are supported if the seeds are bilateral indicated with {hemi}.seed, with the actual seed names being L.seed.nii.gz/R.seed.nii.gz. A singe seed can be given as well.

## NFACT Dr

This is the dual regression module of NFACT. Depending on which decompostion method was used depends on which 
dual regression technique will be used. If NMF was used then non-negative least squares regression will be used, if ICA
then it will be standard regression.

### Usage
```
usage: nfact_dr [-h] [-l LIST_OF_SUBJECTS] [-o OUTDIR] [-a ALGO] [--seeds SEEDS] [-n NFACT_DECOMP_DIR] [-d DECOMP_DIR] [-N]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -l LIST_OF_SUBJECTS, --list_of_subjects LIST_OF_SUBJECTS
                        REQUIRED: Filepath to a list of subjects
  -o OUTDIR, --outdir OUTDIR
                        REQUIRED: Path to output directory
  -a ALGO, --algo ALGO  REQUIRED: Which NFACT algorithm to perform dual regression on
  --seeds SEEDS, -s SEEDS
                        REQUIRED: File of seeds used in NFACT_PP/probtrackx
  -n NFACT_DECOMP_DIR, --nfact_decomp_dir NFACT_DECOMP_DIR
                        REQUIRED IF NFACT_DECOMP: Filepath to the NFACT_decomp directory. Use this if you have ran
                        NFACT decomp
  -d DECOMP_DIR, --decomp_dir DECOMP_DIR
                        REQUIRED IF NOT NFACT_DECOMP: Filepath to decomposition components. WARNING NFACT decomp
                        expects components to be named in a set way. See documentation for further info.
  -N, --normalise       normalise components by scaling

```

nfact_dr is independent from nfact_decomp however, nfact_decomp expects a strict naming convention of files. If nfact_decomp has not been ran then group average files and components must all be in the same folder. Components must be named W_dim* and G_dim* with group average files named coords_for_fdt_matrix2, lookup_tractspace_fdt_matrix2.nii.gz.

## NFACT config

NFACT config is a util tool for nfact, that creates a variety of config files to be used in nfact.

NFACT config can create:
1) nfact_config_pipeline.config overview. This config json file is used in the nfact pipeline to have greater control over parameters.  
2) nfact_config_decomp.config. A config file to control the hypereparameters of the ICA and NMF functions.
3) nfact_config_sublist. A list of subjects in a folder. 


## Usage:
```
usage: nfact_config [-h] [-C] [-D] [-s SUBJECT_LIST] [-o OUTPUT_DIR]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -C, --config          Creates a config file for NFACT pipeline
  -D, --decomp_only     Creates a config file for sckitlearn function hyperparameters
  -s SUBJECT_LIST, --subject_list SUBJECT_LIST
                        Creates a subject list from a given directory
  -o OUTPUT_DIR, --output_dir OUTPUT_DIR
                        Where to save config file

```
Altering a boolean value in a json is done by giving then everything has to be lower case i.e true, false. It is advised that unless you are familar with json 
files to use a json linter to check they are valid. 

### nfact_config_pipeline.config overview

This is the config file for the nfact pipeline. Please check the individual modules for further details on arguments.

```
{
    "global_input": {
        "list_of_subjects": "Required",
        "outdir": "Required",

        "config": false
    },
    "nfact_dr": {
        "normalise": false
    }
}

```

Everything that has says is required must be given. rois, warps and seed must be given in python list format like this
```
"seed": ["l_seed.nii.gz", "r_seed.nii.gz]
```

### nfact_config_decomp.config 

This is the nfact_config_decomp.config file.

NFACT does its decomposition using sckit learn's FastICA (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.FastICA.html#sklearn.decomposition) and NFM (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.NMF.html) so any of the hyperparameters of these functions can be altered by changing the values in the json file.

```
{
    "ica": {
        "algorithm": "parallel",
        "whiten": "unit-variance",
        "fun": "logcosh",
        "fun_args": null,
        "max_iter": 200,
        "tol": 0.0001,
        "w_init": null,
        "whiten_solver": "svd",

        "l1_ratio": 0.0,
        "verbose": 0,
        "shuffle": false
    }
}
```

### nfact_config_sublist

NFACT config will attempt to given a directory work out and write to a file all the subjects in that file. Though nfact will try and filter out 
folders that aren't subjects, it isn't perfect so please check the subject list.
