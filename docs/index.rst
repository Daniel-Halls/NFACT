**NFACT** (Non-negative matrix Factorisation of Tractography data) is a set of modules (as well as an end to end pipeline) that decomposes 
tractography data using NMF/ICA.

NFACT pre-processes data ready for decomposition, performs group level decomposition and output then projects back to the subject level.
It is also able to produce qulaity control output, create spatialmaps and component loadings for further statistical testing as well as 
create confirguation files.
